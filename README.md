# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

In this project, a javascript code is written to create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset ](StarterCode/static/js/data.js) provided. Users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values. 

## Task
### 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
* Create a basic HTML index web page
* Use the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, append a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

### 2: Multiple Search Categories
* Use multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
